								Jessica Leung, the face behind Jaelle, is a local designer
								that puts a personal touch to her creations by hand-crafting
								each and every product. Searching throughout Vancouver for 
								materials to source locally, she creates unique producs
								inspired by nature and the shops around Granville Island.
								<br><br>

								Always an artist at heart, Jessica continuously expresses her
								creativity through various mediums of art such as drawing,
								origami, crafts and jewelry crafting.

							As an avid environmentalist, we are cognizant of the materials 
							that we use in our jewelry. We are aware that some people may
							be sensitive to certain alloys that are typically used in 
							jewelry, such as copper and nickel. That's why we make it a 
							goal to always use rare and pure metals such as gold and silver
							in our work.

								We love repurposing old items and turning them into something
								new! When others see that their old and broken necklace is no
								longer usable, we see a beautiful opportunity to get messy!
								This means deconstructing old and broken jewelry and using
								bits and pieces of it to create something new. Isn't that
								exciting? Visit our 
								<a href="http://www.jaelledesigns.tumblr.com">blog </a> to see
								it in action!

						<div class = "twelve columns">
							<p class = "about-content"> 
								<i>Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?</i> There's
								something valuable you can learn from the ol' Disney classic,
								<i>Pocahontas</i>. Whether it is the fiery canvas of a sunset
								or the soft lull of rain against a window, we believe that
								inspiration is everywhere. Our process begins by observing the
								natural color palettes that exist in nature. Take for example,
								the <a href="#">Kumquat necklace</a>. It is inspired by a humble hummingbird that happened to pass by my window one summer's day.
								<br><br>

								Have a story to tell? Share it with us and get a 
								<a href="#">custom piece</a> that commemorates it!
